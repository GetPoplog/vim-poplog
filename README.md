# vim-poplog

**WARNING: WORK IN PROGRESS**

This project adds support for the [`pop11` language](https://getpoplog.github.io/)
to the Vim editor. It handles syntax highlighting for `*.io` files.

## Installation
We recommend you use [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) or another vim
plugin manager.

For example, using Plug you would add the following to your `~/.vimrc`:
```vim
Plug 'GetPoplog/vim-poplog'
```
